  This work describes a new approach for the design and implementation of a distributed routing application for the Web-Application-Messaging-Protocol (WAMP). A prototypical implementation of this design is tested within the Autobahnkreuz WAMP routing application. The router is capable of running in a distributed setup where several instances of the routing application are running on multiple machines. The Raft consensus algorithm is used for the state synchronization of each routing instance. The performance of the implementation is compared against other implementations based on the scalability, the message throughput, and the resource usage.
